- [DONE] Correct signal handling commands for lldb
- [DONE] Correct environment variable setting commands for lldb

- [DONE] File bug to lldb-mi that interpreter-exec not properly prefix console output by '~'
    + In MICmdCmdMiscellanous.cpp:CMICmdCmdInterpreterExec::Acknowledge()

- [DONE] Port DebugJob
- [DONE] Port exam core and attach process to KJob
- [DONE] Move DebuggerPlugin to MIDebuggerPlugin

- [DONE] Verify how unit test works in test_gdb
- [DONE] Create minimal unit test cases to be able to test debugger and debugsession
    + [DONE] can break on start
    + environment var successfully set
    + Check if lldb supports unicode correctly
        * a program output in encoding other than utf8 and different from host system default
    + set-tty actually works

- [DONE] Verify MIParser/MILexer can handle output without any stream prefix: no they can't

- File bug to lldb-mi
    * HIGH PRIORITY: -break-insert
        + pending breakpoints set with '-f' not got resolved after file loaded
            - fix is simple from lldb-mi side but quite difficult from kdevelop side.
              maybe should write the patch myself
        + pending breakpoints '-f' can only be last flag switch
        + create disabled breakpoint with '-d' not working when combined with '-f'
    * HIGH PRIORITY: lldb-mi creashes when there are multiple threads when break
        + terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
            what():  basic_string::_M_construct null not valid
    * breakpoint hit doesn't generate corresponding breakpoint-modified notification
      (needed to update hitCount)
    * -break-watch command not supported
        + use raw cli command 'break set var' doesn't provides MI response
    * when hit watch point, nothing is output, which confuses the controller
    * thread-info returns malformated result
        + there should be only one 'frame' key for each thread in the list
        + there shoule be a current-thread-id field

- Data formatter for lldb
    * if this works in MI?
    * print static member?
- Disasembly format string
    * implement asm-demangle?
- Fix other missing commands by using cli commands
- Fix TODOs in files

- File bug to lldb-mi for other missing commands

- Change test_gdb to avoid direct use of QTest::qWait, which starts event loop, and could cause session to
  be deleted. Use WAIT_FOR_STATE_AND_IDLE(session, <previous state>) instead. Or use QPointer for session.
